# Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user-provided health parameters. 
By leveraging trained models on medical datasets, this system aims to provide early detection and risk assessment for multiple health conditions, aiding users in taking preventive measures
or seeking medical consultation.

# Features
1. Multiple Disease Detection: Predicts diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and more based on relevant health metrics.
2. User-friendly Interface: A simple and interactive frontend for users to input their health details.
3. Machine Learning Models: Utilizes trained models for accurate disease prediction.
4. Real-time Predictions: Provides instant feedback based on user input.
5. Scalable & Expandable: Can integrate more diseases with additional datasets and models.

# How It Works
1. Users input their health details (e.g., age, blood pressure, glucose level, BMI, etc.).
2. The data is processed and fed into a trained machine learning model.
3. The model predicts the probability of the disease.
4. The result is displayed to the user along with recommendations.
